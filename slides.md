# Examples

* read the contents of a receipt, ask an LLM to generate a description of the kind of person who would buy those items (with some nudging), then ask a diffusion model to _draw_ the description
* have people decorate plastic balls with playdough, then use the Gemini API to create a description of the planet
* convert an image into a sequence of numbers in order to make it easier to _weave_ that image
